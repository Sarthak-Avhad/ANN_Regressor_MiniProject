# 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) – Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to solve a **regression problem**.  
The model learns complex relationships between input features and a continuous target variable to make accurate predictions.
